### Prerequisites:

* Card image files are not included in the repository. Click <a href="http://db.tt/n9tyf9Bk">here</a> to download, and place them to where they should be.

* If you use your own card image files, note that each Quest Card image `*.jpg` must also be splited to `*-A.jpg` and `*-B.jpg`. `resource/quest_cards_splitter.py` is doing this.


### Usage:

`python Launcher.py`


### Tested dependencies:

* Python 2.7.2

* PyQt   4.9.1

* PIL    1.1.7  (optional, for splitting Quest Cards)


### License:

* Python codes are licensed under GNU GPL v2.
