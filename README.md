### About Card Image Files

* Card image files included in the repository are stripped. You can replace them by your own scans, just follow the same naming.

* If you do so, note that each Quest Card image `*.jpg` must also be splitted to `*-A.jpg` and `*-B.jpg`. `resource/quest_cards_splitter.py` is doing this.


### Usage

`python Launcher.py`

Windows binary can be found in the blog post.


### Tested Dependencies

* Python 2.7.2

* PyQt   4.9.1

* PIL    1.1.7  (optional, for splitting Quest Cards)


### License

* Python codes are licensed under GNU GPL v2.
